# AUTOMATED-STUDENTS-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
Attendance management is important to every single organization such as employees and  students to keep a track of their daily schedule and maximize their performance. Managing student attendance during lecture periods has become a difficult challenge and major task as  manual computation produces errors, and wastes a lot of time. For the stated reason, an efficient  Android application for attendance management system is designed to track student's activity in  the class. This application takes attendance electronically and the records of the attendance are  stored in a database. Google Firebase is used for the Application Database to develop  iOS,Android and Web Apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking the analytics, reporting and  fixing app crashes. Tensorflow is used for an image classification with pertained models and  image segmentation to predict whether the pixels of image is associated with a certain class  trained with peoples, places and more. Insertions, deletions, and changes of data in the system  can do straightforward via the designed GUI without interacting with the tables. Different  presentation of information is obtainable from the system. The test case of the system exposed  that the system is working enormously and is ready to use to manage to attend students for any  department of the University.
